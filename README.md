# ANDYGLOVER.DEV
This is my developer website, which will also serve as my professional portfolio. It's got some social media links and pictures for now, more to come!

This is my website.

This project is published at: http://www.andyglover.dev

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

One thing I am really proud of is getting those instagram pictures to look good on any screen size. Before, the layout was a bit funky, but after I learned some CSS grid, I was able to get them to display correctly, namely on a smartphone screen! Woohoo!

## Optimizations

I'd really like to put more of my projects up on this site, but right now, my GitHub profile serves as my portfolio.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first time using CSS grid, and I think one of the first times I used the hover pseudoclass to change opacity of images on mouseover. A fancy effect!
